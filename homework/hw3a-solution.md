# HW3A Solution — Git and Version Control

## Part 1: Repository Cloning
- I cloned the instructor repository into `class_repo`.
- I checked the remote and recent commits.

## Part 2: Portfolio Repository Creation
- I created `my_repo` with `homework/`, `projects/`, and `notes/`.
- I added `README.md` and `.gitignore`.
- I committed the changes.

## Part 3: GitHub Publishing
- I created a public GitHub repository named `py4eda-work`.
- I set the remote `origin` to: https://github.com/IsmailAuburn/py4eda-work
- I pushed the local `main` branch to GitHub.
